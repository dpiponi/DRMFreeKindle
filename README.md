Going DRM[^1] Free on the Kindle
--------------------------------

I own Kindles and already have Kindle books. I want to cut down my dependence on Amazon but I want to continue using my Kindle devices and continue to read new material.

It is possible to transfer books in the EPUB and PDF format to Kindles as long as they are DRM-free. You can mail them to Amazon or use the Send-to-Kindle app,

# [eBooks](https://ebooks.com)
"Launched in 2000, eBooks.com is a popular ebook retailer with a reputation for innovation, integrity and independence. We sell ebooks direct to millions of consumers around the world, with five local sales portals in the US, Canada, UK, Europe and Australia."

They have a [link](https://www.ebooks.com/en-us/drm-free/) to their DRM-free books. You can filter DRM-free books. But make sure before you purchase as it's easy to accidentally lose the DRM-free filtering.

# [Baen](baen.com)
"Founded by Jim Baen, Baen Books has been bringing readers pulse-pounding, thought-provoking adventures straight from the heart of science fiction and fantasy for decades. We publish books in hardcover, paperback, and electronic form, and are one of the few traditional publishers that maintains its own ebooks webstore (with at least four new titles added every month)....In addition, we also sell ebooks from other publishers. We sell more than 2000 books from over 500 authors published by 24 different companies. Good reading to all!"

They can send directly to Kindle account so you don't need to download first.

# [Tartarus Press](https://tartaruspress.com)
"Tartarus is a small, British independent press founded in 1990. We specialise in collectable hardback limited editions of literary supernatural/strange/horror fiction, and we also publish paperbacks and ebooks."

Very small and old-school. If you order a book they'll send you an email with an attachment.

# [Tachyon](https://tachyonpublications.com)
"Founded in 1995, Tachyon Publications LLC is a publisher of smart science fiction, fantasy, and horror, as well as mysteries, memoirs, young adult, and literary fiction.

They are a DRM-free house.

# [Humble Bundle](https://humblebundle.com)
Check here frequently as they have a continually varying roster of [bundles](https://www.humblebundle.com/books) at unbelievably low prices and part of your payment goes to a good cause. Book formats vary but they often include DRM-free epubs.

2000AD is the home of Judge Dredd. They are a DRM-free house. A significant portion of British comic history is available here.

# [DriveThruRPG](https://drivethrurpg.com) and [DriveThruFiction](drivethrufiction.com).
DTRPG mostly sell RPG material but they also sell RPG-adjacent material such as fiction by RPG authors. They use a variety of formats. They did try using DRM for a while but it didn't work out so now they are DRM-free.

Mostly technical books. I believe they are DRM-free.

# [LeanPub](https://leanpub.com)
Mostly technical books.

# [Booskhop.org](https://bookshop.org)
I am told this organization sells DRM-free ebooks alongside books with DRM. I haven't checked.

[^1]: DRM is Digital Rights Management. It's software used to prevent you from reading books that you buy. It will prevent you reading books in the file format of your choice or on the device of your choice and it also prevents you from giving the book to someone else after you've finished it. DRM can be removed although it is illegal in much of the world.
